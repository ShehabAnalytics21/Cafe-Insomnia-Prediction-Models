<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project:
*	Bellingen Riverwatch government initiative aims to create a safe environment for the Bellinger River Snapping Turtle by collaborating with the local community and by spreading awareness of the importance of this endeavour. 
*	The data collected are provided in the “bellingen-riverwatch-ongoing-data_last-updated-20210812_ig.xlsx” file in the “riverwatch data” folder. 
*	The name of the sites along with their exact location is provided in the “bellingenriverwatch_sites.csv” file in the “rvierwatch data” folder. 
*	The volunteer manual and Data Quality Analysis (DQS) are also provided in the “rvierwatch data” folder to provide more information about the methodology and settings of the initiative.
*	The main report is provided as Jupyter Notebook in the file named “Bellingen Riverwatch EDA.ipynb”.

* In this report, an in-depth EDA was conducted to answer the following questions: 
  1.	What is the general relationship between all numerical variables?
  2.	Does the BR water quality meet the ANZECC Freshwater Quality Guidelines & Ratings?
  3.	How does the water quality of BR change annually?
  4.	How does the water quality of BR change every summer?
  5.	What is the relationship between "Water level or flow" and water quality?
  6.	What is the relationship between "Rainfall in last 7 days" and water quality?
